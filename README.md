This is a basic expense tracker app, that allows the user to track their expenses.

As of now, there is no backend connected to it. I just want to focus on the frontend functionality.

Let me walk you through the features:
- The user can see the list of expenses ( I have hardcoded 2 expenses )
- The user can add new expense
- I have a floating action button, but I don't why it exists, will probably remove it ðŸ˜“

Some things I would like to add:
- Delete feature: The old fashion method of having a pop up menu, you know, the one with the 3 vertical dots, that allows you to delete is so boring. I want something unique
- To spice things up and allow the user keep track of his expenses well, and help him have the right balance between his spendings, I would like to have a chart, preferrably bar chart. I would prefer not using flutter charts, as they release a lot of unstable versions. And, what is better than applying the flutter concepts and making our own custom chart (yeah, it involves math, I know ðŸ˜” )

Flex your skills and showcase your kindness!
Thank you!!!!!!
